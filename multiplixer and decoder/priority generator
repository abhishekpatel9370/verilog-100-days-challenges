4-Bit Priority Generator with Even/Odd Priority

Overview

This project implements a 4-bit Priority Generator that determines the priority based on the parity of the input bits. It classifies the priority into even priority and odd priority using XOR operations.

Features

Accepts a 4-bit input (data_in).

Computes even priority using XOR logic.

Determines odd priority as the complement of even priority.

Implements combinational logic using Verilog.

Module Description

Module Name: priority_gen4bit

Inputs:

data_in [3:0] → 4-bit input data.

Outputs:

even_priority → Outputs 1 if the number of 1s in data_in is even.

odd_priority → Outputs 1 if the number of 1s in data_in is odd (complement of even_priority).
